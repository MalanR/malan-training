// Dependency Inversion Principle

// Design a Notification System that can send messages via different channels.

// Implement a base abstraction for sending notifications.
// Create at least two implementations (e.g., Email and SMS).
// Your system should not depend on specific notification types but instead depend on an abstraction.
